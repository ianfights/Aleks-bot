# Aleks Bot
## What Is It?
The Aleks bot is a bot designed for automatic completion of the Aleks math program
## Why?
The project originally started when I was tired of doing Aleks, however as the teachers stopped using Aleks my motivation changed to seeing if I could do it

## How Will It WOrk?
There are many paths that I have already taken as you can see in the commit history.
Each of them had their pros and evolved as I became better at coding

This version will likely incorperate two of the previous methods

1. A community driven tool styled after services like 2captcha
2. Scraping the webpage for the numbers and doing the math on them likely using sonething like math.js

Side Note: This project has evolved over the years and will likely continue to do so. Everything in this will likely change including the language (Which has already changed three times). I don't know if I will ever finish this project either so don't get your hopes up.
